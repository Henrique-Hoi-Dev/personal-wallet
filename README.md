## The Suite :package:

- API Server para backend aplicação
- Web Client para aplicação

## Few Things Under The Hood :factory:

### Built using the MEVN Stack & The Usual Suspects

MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Express.js, Vue.js, Node.js, Mongoose ORM, Redis, Sendgrid, Nodemailer (for fallback), Stripe.

### Performant & Secure - cause we like it that way

- Distributed requests utilizing all system cores,
- Encrypted authentication and sessions,
- Backend equipped with request rate limiting to prevent scripted attacks and bot crawling,
- Database & file-based logging.

### Built for the Cloud, with developers in mind

- CD/CI friendly codebase and configuration setup,
- Simplified dev-prod and local-cloud switches,
- Docker scripts,
- AWS S3 Integration for cheap image storage.

### Granular controls

- Drag-and-drop design builders for home page customizations,
- Image Editor to edit and preview product images and thumbnails,
- Order tracking at a line item level,
- Tariff support for international shipments,
- Payment accepted in multiple digital forms and currencies powered by Stripe.
